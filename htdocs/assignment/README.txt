DEV NOTES - 01/03/2021

NOTES:
	place.php only has to be edited for place pages. Only the place name is requiered for the function to work.
	Mapping API is complete as far as I'm aware. Weather API widget is but can benefit from formatting if desired or have time.
	The website has issues with responsiveness to size change currently. Place pages are better but the side column shad doesn't extend.
	Footer divs been left for optional (copyrights etc.) 



TO DO LIST:
	Format nav bar to be consistent and presentable across all pages.
	City page: center column needs to resize for description
	City page: description could be formatted better
	Place page: profile similar to city pages could be added. Spare div on right of page.
	Image alt text: descriptions could be added to database and selected with other data to fill space of alt text inside <img> tag using php. See existing code for reference.
	I had already got images for the Gdynia church so was not prepared to change this. If someone wants to change it to fit with the new place instead that would be great.


Thanks and good luck.
